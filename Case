"Generative AI Personal Assistant for Customer Service and Sales on WhatsApp"

Project Description

The purpose of this project is to design and develop a generative AI-based personal assistant for customer service and sales, implemented on the WhatsApp platform. This assistant is designed to improve the user experience, streamline customer service processes, and optimize sales conversion through automated and personalized responses in real time.

General Objective

Develop a virtual assistant with Generative AI that automates customer service and facilitates the sales process through WhatsApp, optimizing response times and improving user satisfaction.

Specific Objectives

1. Analyze user requirements and needs to ensure an efficient assistant design.
2. Design the assistant's architecture, integrating generative AI to understand and generate natural responses.
3. Implement and train the AI ​​model with relevant data to ensure accurate and consistent responses.
4. Integrate the assistant with the WhatsApp API for proper operation on the platform.
5. Evaluate the assistant's performance through user interaction tests and optimize its performance based on feedback and analytical data.

Methodology

The SCRUM methodology will be used for the development of the assistant, due to its iterative and incremental approach. The project will be divided into development sprints with the following phases:

1. Planning: Defining the assistant's requirements and objectives
2. Design: Creating the chatbot architecture, dialogs, and conversational flow
3. Development: Implementing the assistant with generative AI and integrating it with WhatsApp
4. Testing: Evaluating the accuracy and effectiveness of responses in real-life interactions
5. Deployment and Optimization: Implementation in a production environment and continuous improvement based on user feedback

Tools (Suggestions)

1. Languages ​​and frameworks: Python, Node.js
2. Generative AI: OPENAI GPT-4, Llama 2, or similar
3. Messaging API: WhatsApp Business API (Twilio or Meta API)
4. Databases: PostgresSQL or Firebase
5. Cloud infrastructure: AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure
6. Analytics platform: Google Analytics, Power BI

Project Components

1. Natural Language Processing Module: Allows the interpretation and generation of responses in natural language.
2. Knowledge Base: Contains information about products, company policies, and frequently asked questions.
3. WhatsApp Integration: Connects to the WhatsApp API to receive and send messages.
4. Administration Panel: Interface for configuring responses, training the model, and viewing usage statistics.
5. Analysis and Reporting System: Allows measuring the assistant's effectiveness and improving its performance based on collected data.

This project seeks to improve customer service, increase sales, and optimize response times by implementing artificial intelligence in WhatsApp.
